# Pre-check Adaptive Card template

> Companion for the **precost** skill, used at **Step 7** only. Read this when you
> render the card. Fill in the values from Steps 1–6; keep colours subtle and
> on-brand. **Drop the "Run it leaner" Recommendations block when Step 5 found no
> levers.** Render it inline via the `render-ui` skill — never write it to a file.
> Keep the disclaimer wording exactly as below.
>
> **Badge and cost must agree.** The `Estimated cost` band is the §6 band for the
> **effective class** (the badge). A heavy input (`.pptx`, scanned PDF, images) or an
> expensive tool bumps the class up one level in Step 3 *before* you read the band —
> so e.g. a Medium task with a `.pptx` shows **HEAVY · ≈ 700–1400 credits · ≈ $7–14**,
> not a Medium band multiplied by a weight. The example below is a plain Medium task
> (text PDF, no bump).
