  Runs a fast, visual "cost & value" pre-check on a Copilot Cowork task BEFORE
  the work starts. Estimates credits from five cost signals (model, context size,
  runtime, tools / skills / plugins, attachment weight), classifies the task as
  Light / Medium / Heavy, estimates Copilot Credits, dollar cost, time saved and
  value returned, shows it as an inline Adaptive Card with a disclaimer and
  sustainability tips, then asks whether to proceed, proceed more sustainably, or
  use a lighter tool (Copilot Chat / M365 Copilot).
  Invoke when the user types "/precost", "precost", "pre-check first", "cost check",
  "estimate this task", "what will this cost", "is this worth running in Cowork",
  or "should I run this here".
  Do NOT use for follow-ups or refinements WITHIN a task already in progress, or to
  report the real metered cost of a finished task (that is the built-in /cost
  command and the Cost Management dashboard).

# precost — Cowork Task Cost & ROI Pre-check

A lightweight gate that runs **once at the start of a new task** (or whenever the
user types **`/precost`**). It tells the user, before any credits are spent,
roughly what the task will **cost** and what it will **return**, shows it
visually inline, points out how to run it more **sustainably**, and lets them
decide whether to proceed, proceed leaner, or switch to a cheaper tool.

Keep it **fast**. This is a quick estimate, not research. The only lookups
allowed are the cheap, local ones: read the active model from the session, list
attachments with `Glob`, and **Read the companion reference files in this
folder**. Do **not** call search, email, calendar, web, or file-content tools to
produce the estimate.

## Reference files (load on demand — cheap local Reads)

All the pricing/value detail lives in three files in this folder so this workflow
stays short. **Read the relevant file when the step says to** — a local `Read` is
cheap and fast, unlike web/search.

- **`pricing-reference.md`** — official Cowork/Copilot pricing, the credit model,
  model cost multipliers (§4), attachment weights (§5), base credit bands (§6),
  and the adjustment formula (§7). Use it in Steps 1–3.
- **`value-and-routing.md`** — time-saved/value bands & formula (§1), verdict
  logic (§2), which-Copilot-to-use routing (§3), and the **step-by-step
  instructions** for doing the task in M365 Copilot / Copilot Chat (§4). Use it in
  Steps 4, 6, and 8.
- **`card-template.md`** — the ready-to-fill Adaptive Card JSON skeleton. Use it
  in Step 7.

These files are the **single source of truth** for every number this skill
quotes. Do not invent figures that aren't in them.

## When to run

- The user types **`/precost`** (or "precost", "pre-check first", "cost check").
- The user has just delegated a **new task** to Cowork (the first substantive
  request of a task), e.g. "prep me for my customer meeting and build a deck",
  "analyze this data and produce a report", "draft and send the team update".

## When NOT to Use (when NOT to run)

- **Follow-ups within the same task** — "make the title bigger", "add a slide",
  "change the tone", "now email it too". The pre-check already ran for this task;
  do not run it again.
- Pure questions / chit-chat that aren't a delegated task ("what's on my
  calendar?", "who is the PM for X?").
- A request for the **actual** cost of a completed task — point the user to the
  built-in `/cost` command and the Cost Management dashboard instead.

## Step 1 — Gather the five cost signals (cheap, local only)

Read these five signals to build the most approximate estimate, from the prompt +
session + a quick attachment listing only — no expensive lookups.

1. **Model in use.** Detect the active model from the session/environment, then
   apply its credit multiplier. **The multiplier table is `pricing-reference.md`
   §4** (anchored to the Cowork default, **Opus 4.8 = 1.0×**; 1 credit ≈ $0.01).
   If the model can't be determined, assume the Cowork default (Opus 4.8, 1.0×)
   and say so on the card.
2. **Context size.** Roughly how much material the model must read/hold — sources,
   timeframe, attachment size, prior conversation. More context = more input
   tokens = more credits. Judge it **small / moderate / large**.
3. **Runtime.** Roughly how long it runs (more turns + tool calls = more credits).
   Light ≈ under a minute; Medium ≈ 1–3 min; Heavy ≈ 3 min+.
4. **Tools / skills / plugins.** Which capabilities the task invokes:
   - **Cheap:** a single read (one calendar/email/file), one render card.
   - **Moderate:** multi-source M365 search, a doc skill (`docx`/`xlsx`/`pptx`),
     a few tool calls.
   - **Expensive:** `ImageGenerate`, `deep-research`, browser automation,
     multi-step workflows, or anything that spawns subagents.
5. **Attachments.** List them (`Glob input/**/*`) and note type + size. **Format
   drives credit weight far more than file size — the weight table is
   `pricing-reference.md` §5.** (`.md` cheapest; PDFs/slides/images cost
   multiples more.)

> Read `pricing-reference.md` now to pull the model-multiplier and
> attachment-weight tables for Steps 1–3.

## Step 2 — Classify the base task (Light / Medium / Heavy)

Judge the task on sources, reasoning depth, and deliverables to set the **base**
credit band. **The band table (credits + USD per class) is `pricing-reference.md`
§6.** Pick the class by the **heaviest signal present** (one short email summary =
Light; multi-source briefing + Excel + deck = Medium; 6-month data analysis +
leadership report vs. prior period = Heavy).

## Step 3 — Adjust the estimate (model + one class bump)

Turn the base band into the final band with the formula in **`pricing-reference.md`
§7** — deliberately just **two** levers, so the estimate is reproducible and the
badge always matches the number:

```
adjusted_credits ≈ base_band(effective_class) × model_multiplier
```

- **effective_class:** start from the Step 2 class, then **bump up one level** if a
  **heavy input** (`.pptx`, scanned PDF, or several images) **or** an **expensive
  tool** (`ImageGenerate`, `deep-research`, browser automation, subagents) is present;
  **bump down** for a single trivial read on a light (`.md`/`.txt`/`.csv`) input;
  otherwise keep it. Move by the heaviest driver only — don't stack bumps.
- **model_multiplier:** apply §4 (Opus 4.8 = 1.0× baseline; Sonnet 4.6 ≈ 0.6×; etc.).
- Do **not** also multiply by attachment weight or a context/tool factor — the class
  already prices context, runtime and tools, and the §5 weights only decide the bump.
- Keep the result a **band**, never false-precise. Round to clean ranges, e.g.
  **"≈ 200–450 credits · ≈ $2–4.50 (Sonnet 4.6)."**

## Step 4 — Estimate the return (time saved + value)

Map the task to the Cowork ROI categories and **sum the Typical minutes saved**
for the categories it touches (a multi-part task touches several). **The category
table, the value formula, and the default `HOURLY_RATE` (€75/hr) are in
`value-and-routing.md` §1.** Cost is USD; value is the user's currency; do **not**
invent an FX rate — present them side by side.

## Step 5 — Sustainability check (recommendations + a leaner prompt)

Decide whether the **same outcome** could be reached for fewer credits. Only raise
levers that genuinely apply — never pad. Common, concrete levers:

- **Model right-sizing.** Routine task (summary, extraction, simple draft) on a
  heavy model (Opus 4.8 / a premium model)? Recommend Sonnet 4.6 / an efficiency
  model. Genuinely hard reasoning? Keep the heavy model.
- **Lighter attachments.** No-image PDF / scanned doc attached? Recommend
  converting to `.md` first (multiples cheaper). Flag image-heavy or `.pptx`
  inputs as the cost driver.
- **Tighter scope.** Broad prompt ("analyze everything")? Suggest narrowing the
  timeframe, source set, or number of deliverables.
- **Cheaper route.** Single artifact or quick Q&A? Point to Copilot Chat / M365
  Copilot (no metered credits — see Step 6).

If at least one lever applies, prepare a **sustainable rewrite** of the user's
prompt (same goal, leaner execution) to offer in Step 8. If nothing meaningful
applies, say the task is already running efficiently and skip the recommendations.

## Step 6 — Verdict & whether to suggest an alternative

Apply the **verdict logic and the which-Copilot-to-use routing table in
`value-and-routing.md` §2–§3**:

- **Strongly positive** — time-value clearly dwarfs credit cost (typical for
  Medium/Heavy multi-deliverable tasks). Recommend **proceed**.
- **Marginal** — a Light task a per-seat tool does at **no metered credit cost**.
  Suggest the alternative (Copilot Chat / M365 Copilot) but let the user choose.

## Step 7 — Render the visual card (inline, not a file)

Render the estimate as an **Adaptive Card in the conversation** via the
`render-ui` skill (invoke `render-ui`, then `render_ui`). Never write it to a
file. Keep it compact and professional. Include, in this order:

1. **Title** — "Cowork task pre-check"
2. A **Badge** for the class: `Light` / `Medium` / `Heavy`.
3. A **FactSet**: `Model`, `Estimated cost` (adjusted band), `Attachments`,
   `Estimated time saved`, `Estimated value` (state the hourly rate), `Verdict`.
4. **Recommendations** (only if Step 5 found levers) — a short `TextBlock` list,
   e.g. "Switch to Sonnet 4.6 · Convert the PDF to .md · Narrow to last 30 days".
5. A short **disclaimer** TextBlock (small, `isSubtle: true`, `wrap: true`) — use
   this exact concise wording:

   > *Estimate only — not the metered bill. It factors the model, context,
   > runtime, tools and attachments, but the real cost depends on what actually
   > runs and is shown by `/cost` and the Cost Management dashboard after the
   > task. This pre-check is advisory, not a spending limit, and uses
   > research-based pricing and time-savings bands (directional, not a
   > guarantee). Running this check itself uses a small amount of credits.*

A **ready-to-fill JSON skeleton** lives in **`card-template.md`** (this folder) —
Read it at this step, fill in the values, keep colours subtle and on-brand, and
drop the "Run it leaner" block when Step 5 found no levers.

## Step 8 — Ask how to proceed

Immediately after the card, use **AskUserQuestion** (one question) so the user
decides after reading the numbers. Tailor the options to what applies:

- **Question:** "How would you like to proceed?"
- **Options:**
  - **"Proceed in Cowork"** — run the task as written (recommend for Medium/Heavy).
  - **"Use Cowork — sustainably"** — *offer this whenever Step 5 found at least one
    lever.* On selection: apply the **sustainable rewrite** from Step 5 (switch the
    model where supported, convert heavy attachments to `.md`, tighten scope),
    briefly list the adjustments made, then run the task with the leaner setup.
  - **"Use Copilot Chat / M365 Copilot instead"** — *offer for marginal/Light
    tasks.* On selection: **Read `value-and-routing.md` §4, pick the recipe that
    matches the task, and walk the user through the concrete step-by-step** for
    that tool (which app, which button, what to type). Then stop — don't run it in
    Cowork.

**Conditional follow-up:** If the user picks plain **"Proceed in Cowork"** *and* a
sustainable rewrite is available, ask one more short question before starting:
"Want me to convert your prompt into a more sustainable one to save resources?"
— Yes → apply the rewrite and proceed; No → proceed exactly as written.

If they cancel (empty answer) → acknowledge and wait. Never block the task behind
more than these questions.

## Guardrails

- **Run once per task, at the start.** Never re-run on follow-ups or refinements
  within the same task.
- **Only cheap, local lookups for the estimate** — detect the active model, list
  attachments (`Glob`), and Read the companion files in this folder. Do
  **not** call search, email, calendar, web, or file-content tools. Stay fast.
- **Never present the estimate as the real bill.** Always show the disclaimer. The
  authoritative figures are `/cost` and the Cost Management dashboard, which the
  user runs **after** the task completes.
- **Quote ranges, not false precision.** Cost is a band read from the effective
  class and scaled only by the model multiplier (heavy inputs / expensive tools move
  the class up one level — they are not extra multipliers); value uses a stated,
  user-editable hourly rate.
- **Recommend sustainability only when it genuinely helps.** Don't invent levers;
  if the task already runs efficiently, say so and skip the recommendations.
- **Advisory, not enforcement.** This does not block spend — only admin spending
  limits/alerts do that.
- **Card is inline only** — render via the `render-ui` skill; never write it to
  `output/`.
- **No fabrication.** Use only the credit bands, model multipliers, attachment
  weights, time-savings bands, and routing in `pricing-reference.md` and
  `value-and-routing.md`, plus the signals you can actually observe (model,
  attachments, prompt). Do not invent credit figures, dollar amounts, savings
  numbers, an FX rate, or a model that isn't in use. If the task doesn't map
  cleanly to a class or category, say it's a rough estimate rather than guessing.
